# Minimal intron analyses and datasets

- **exon_intron_sizes** - Scripts to visualise introns and exons sizes across four organisms (human, fly, worm & zebrafish) 
- **intron_pictograms** - Scripts to visualise donor and acceptor site pictograms across all human introns
- **Table 1 - Curated branch points.xlsx** - Curated branchpoints (where distance from donor to branch point is less than 51nt. **Note**: This includes the donor's GT and the branch point nucleotide)
- **Table 2 - Curated introns.xlsx** - Curated introns (where intron length is less than 66nt)
