# Minimal intron analyses and datasets

- **exon_intron_sizes** - Scripts to visualise introns and exons sizes across four organisms (human, fly, worm & zebrafish) 

- **intron_pictograms** - Scripts to visualise donor and acceptor site pictograms across all human introns

| 1 | Curation of intronic indels extracted from ClinVar and LOVD which reduce resultant intron length to ≤ 100 bp. Indels involving the extended donor site (+1 to +5), the predicted branchpoints, or any deletion affecting residues between branchpoint and acceptor (i.e. the polypyrimidine tract were excluded. Branchpoints between 16 – 33 nucleotides of the splice acceptor were curated, corresponding to the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile for branchpoint-acceptor distance (AG inclusive) among short human introns (≤ 110 bp) determined in 2/3 studies reported in <sup>38-40</sup>. The determined<sup>38-40</sup>, or most strongly predicted branchpoint<sup>25</sup>, is underlined and bold. |
| 2 | Curation of 32 introns < 66 nt length extracted from NCBI Refseq |
| 3 | Curation of introns documented within branch point datasets from<sup>38-40</sup>, rendering donor-branchpoint distance ≤ 50 nt |
